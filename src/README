Brief description:
=================
This assignment involves designing and implementing a Java program that models celestial bodies within a planetary
system using object-oriented programming principles. The program features a class hierarchy rooted in the abstract base
class Planet, which encapsulates common attributes shared by all planet types. Specialized subclasses such as GasPlanet
and IcePlanet extend the Planet class, representing different categories of planets.

The program is organized into several packages:
The controller package contains the PlanetSystemAPI class, which manages operations and interactions within the
planetary system.

The main package includes the Driver class to run the application.

The models package defines the core celestial classes (Planet, GasPlanet, IcePlanet).

The utils package provides supporting utilities such as the ISerializer interface for data serialization.

This structure reflects real-world astronomical classifications and provides a clear, organized way to represent the
complexity of planetary systems

***************************

Part A - Inheritance Hierarchy (24 / 24)
line 6 - icePlanet class, public class IcePlanet extends Planet
line 6 - gasPlanet class, public class GasPlanet extends Planet

-----------------------------

Planets (10/10)
IcePlanet( 8 / 8)
GasPlanet ( 8 / 8)


Part B - PlanetSystemAPI  (33 /34)
-----------------------------
basic CRUD (13 /13 )
reporting/numberOf methods (8 / 8)
validation methods  & persistence  (4 / 5)
sorting / top 5 (8 / 8)


Part C - UX (user experience) and Driver:Mark (22 /23)
-----------------------------
Good Menu Structure  (4 / 4)
ArrayListCRUD  - all  types handled  (6 / 7)
Reports Menu - for all planets (7 / 7)
Search, Sort, top5   (4 / 4)
Save, Load, Exit   (1 / 1)



Part D - DX (Overall style) (11%)	 (11 /11)
-----------------------------
Code correctly commented (3 / 3)
Standard naming, indentation, DRY Code etc. (5/ 5)
Javadoc written for PlanetSystemAPI  (3 / 3)

Part E - For Extra Credit (10%)  (10 / 10)
-----------------------------
In main package - Driver Class-
line 223 method -  private void goBackToMainOrCrudMenu().
After adding a planet (Ice or Gas) or encountering invalid input, the program doesn't just stop or return to a
fixed point—it asks the user where they want to go next.
Return to the Main Menu, or Go back to the Planets CRUD Menu (for managing planet data).
This is crucial for user experience, especially in console applications where there's no GUI to help guide navigation.



Rest(5 / 5)

Part F - Reflection (8 / 8)

- PLEASE CHECK IT OUT IN REFLECTION FILE
-----------------------------
Filled out parts A - D above (3 / 3)
---------------------------

=====> Main difficulties I came across in your development of solution and how I solved them:
Navigation Flow: Initially struggled with enabling users to return to the main menu without restarting the program.
➤ Solved by creating a reusable method (goBackToMainOrCrudMenu()) that handles user navigation cleanly.

Switch Statement in Infinite Loop: Had trouble managing case 0 to exit the loop without affecting other options.
➤ Resolved by isolating the exit logic and placing a break statement only within case 0.

XML File Handling with XStream: Faced challenges in saving and loading objects correctly using XML.
➤ Learned how to use XStream with aliasing and corrected object serialization to handle inheritance
(e.g., IcePlanet, GasPlanet).

Code Duplication & Hardcoding: Encountered hardcoded logic in classes like Planet.
➤ Refactored by integrating utility methods (e.g., for validation), making code more modular and reusable.



=====> Any bugs remaining in the solution or unfinished elements of spec (no need if you have detailed these in the
rubric section)
None



=====> Main learnings from my engagement with assignment:
➤ Java OOP Concepts: Gained a solid understanding of inheritance, interfaces, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
➤ Menu Design & Input Handling: Improved at designing structured menu systems and capturing user input safely.
➤ File I/O & XML Serialization: Developed hands-on skills with Java’s I/O streams and XStream for XML persistence.
➤ Debugging & Refactoring: Strengthened problem-solving through debugging and code refactoring for better clarity
and modularity.
➤ Code Maintainability: Learned the importance of breaking code into reusable methods and utility classes to keep the
codebase clean.
